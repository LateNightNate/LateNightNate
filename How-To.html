    <a href="Products.html"> <h2><u>Spam Kit</u></h2> </a>
    <u><H4>Ingredients</H4></u>
    <p>
        -12 ounces Spam
        <br>
        <br>
        -1/4 cup oyster sauce
        <br>
        <br>
        -1/4 cup soy sauce
        <br>
        <br>
        -1/2 cup sugar
        <br>
        <br>
        -Nori roasted seaweed used for sushi, cut into halves or thirds (Cut it into thirds to make it go further)
        <br>
        <br>
        -6 cups cooked sushi rice WITHOUT the vinegar mixture added 
        <br>
        <br>
        </p>
        <u><H4>Steps</H4></u>
        <p>
        Step 1 - Cut the SPAM into 8-10 slices according to your preferred thickness and transfer them into a Ziplock bag. 
        In a separate bowl, combine oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sugar, and stir the mixture until the sugar granules are fully dissolved. 
        Pour the marinade over the SPAM slices in the bag and let them soak for approximately 15 minutes to absorb the flavors.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 2 - After marinating the SPAM, remove it from the bag and allow the excess marinade to drain off. 
        Heat up a frying pan over medium heat and place the SPAM slices in the pan, cooking them on each side until they turn slightly crispy or reach your preferred level of doneness. 
        You may opt to coat the SPAM with the marinade/sauce after frying, which is also a delicious option.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 3 - To prepare your Musubi, start by laying a sheet of nori on a clean surface with the shiny side facing down. 
        Position the Musubi mold in the center of the nori. Take some Sushi Rice and add it to the mold, pressing it down firmly and evenly so that there is about 1 to 1 1/2 inches of rice. 
        To prevent sticking, make sure to dip the mold and your fingers in water as you go along.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 4 - Once you have added the Sushi Rice to the Musubi mold and removed the mold, you will have a compact block of rice sitting on the nori. 
        Place some cooked SPAM on top of the rice block. To wrap the Musubi, start by folding up one side of the nori and pressing it onto the top of the SPAM. Then, fold up the other side, creating a neat little package. If necessary, you can use a dab of water on your finger to help seal the nori. 
        Your Musubi is now ready to serve while still warm and delicious.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 5 - There are various ways to enjoy Musubi according to personal taste preferences. 
        While some prefer to dip it in soy sauce, others might prefer it with ketchup, and there are those who enjoy it as is without any additional condiments.
        <br>
        <br>
        Notes: If you're planning to make a large batch of Musubi for later consumption, it's best to wrap each piece individually with plastic wrap and store them in the refrigerator for up to a week. 
        When you're ready to enjoy them, simply remove the plastic wrap and place the Musubi in the microwave for 15-20 seconds to reheat it. 
        This will help to restore its texture and taste, making it just as delicious as when it was freshly made.

        <a href="Products.html"> <h2><u>Onigiri</u></h2> </a>
        <u><H4>Ingredients</H4></u>
        <p> - For perfect Onigiri, make sure to use Japanese short-grain rice, cooked just right. 
            No other type of rice will work, so keep it simple and stick to the authentic recipe.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Nori seaweed, cut into 9 cm x 3 cm strips
            <br>
            <br>
            - Salt (Optional)
        </p>
            <u><H4>Okaka Filling</H4></u>
        <p>
            - 1 tablespoon bonito flakes (katsuobushi)
            <br>
            <br>
            - 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
        </p>
            <u><H4>Steps</H4></u>
        <p>
            Okaka:
            - Create a delicious filling by mixing bonito flakes and soy sauce in a small bowl. 
            If you find the mixture too dry, you can add more soy sauce, but make sure to do it gradually to avoid making the filling too runny.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 1 - Before assembling your Onigiri, ensure that your mold is clean and damp. 
        Use a damp paper towel to wipe the inside of the mold thoroughly. 
        Also, dampen the removable top piece on the side that will be pushed into the rice. 
        This will help prevent the rice from sticking and make it easier to remove the mold once the Onigiri is assembled.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 2 - For an extra touch of flavor, you can sprinkle a tiny pinch of salt on the inside of the Onigiri mold. 
        Rotate the mold in your hands to ensure that the salt is spread evenly on all sides. 
        While this step is optional, it can enhance the taste of your Onigiri and make it even more enjoyable.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 3 - Scoop warm rice into the Onigiri mold with a rice paddle or spoon until it's just below halfway full. 
        Press the rice firmly into all the crevices of the mold to ensure it's evenly distributed and tightly packed.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 4 - Using the handle of your rice paddle or spoon, create a shallow indentation in the center of the rice mold to make space for the filling.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 5 - Using a spoon, place the okaka filling into the indentation in the center of the rice. 
        Don't worry if it piles up a little bit.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 6 - Fill the mold with more rice until 3/4 full, leaving space for the top piece. Optional: sprinkle salt on top.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 7 - Insert the removable top piece into the mold and apply gentle pressure until it's fully inserted.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 8 - Remove the top piece of the mold and flip it over onto a plate covered in plastic wrap. 
        If necessary, use your thumb to gently push the onigiri out. 
        Gently tap the bottom and sides of the mold until the onigiri slides out.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 9 - Once the onigiri is formed and filled, wrap it with a strip of nori and then with plastic wrap. 
        This will keep the rice moist and prevent the nori from getting soggy. 
        You can now store the onigiri in the fridge until you're ready to eat or pack it in a bento.
